<details style="color: inherit; background: transparent; border: none; margin: 0; padding: 0;"><summary class="c18" id="h.55mez3es0ma5" style="color: inherit; background: transparent; cursor: pointer;"><span class="c1">What is RIIS 2.0?</span></summary>
<p class="c46 c29 c45"><span class="c9 c7">RIIS 2.0 is a California nonprofit public benefit corporation organized under IRS Section 501(c)(3). Its mission is to support and facilitate the execution and dissemination of scholarly research in the public interest. RIIS 2.0 builds on the values of truth, empathy, belonging, and open scholarship, offering independent scholars a community outside traditional academia.</span></p>
</details><details style="color: inherit; background: transparent; border: none; margin: 0; padding: 0;"><summary class="c0" id="h.t0cum8mawzaf" style="color: inherit; background: transparent; cursor: pointer;"><span class="c1">What fields does RIIS 2.0 represent?</span></summary>
<p class="c43 c29 c45"><span class="c9 c7">All of them! Our Research Scholars hail from all across the academic spectrum, from physics to biology to history to philosophy to modern dance and ceramics.</span></p>
</details><details style="color: inherit; background: transparent; border: none; margin: 0; padding: 0;"><summary class="c38 c29" id="h.3ay6tx925432" style="color: inherit; background: transparent; cursor: pointer;"><span class="c1">Do you have departments?</span></summary>
<p class="c29 c45 c51"><span class="c9 c7">No. Many of our Research Scholars decided to pursue independent scholarship specifically because their research interests did not align well with a traditional academic department. As our numbers grow, so do our “affinity groups,” which are groups of Research Scholars with overlapping and complementary interests. Unlike departments, these labels are descriptive, not prescriptive.</span></p>
</details><details style="color: inherit; background: transparent; border: none; margin: 0; padding: 0;"><summary class="c0 c49" id="h.ioss0oe8kyk6" style="color: inherit; background: transparent; cursor: pointer;"><span class="c1">Does RIIS 2.0 support research grant administration?</span></summary>
<p class="c2"><span class="c9 c7">Not at the moment, since with our limited resources, we are currently focused on getting the initial institute off the ground and running sustainably. </span></p>
</details><details style="color: inherit; background: transparent; border: none; margin: 0; padding: 0;"><summary class="c0" id="h.gt2g4wn6rfhf" style="color: inherit; background: transparent; cursor: pointer;"><span class="c1">Does RIIS 2.0 have a library?</span></summary>
<p class="c2"><span class="c9 c7">Unfortunately, no. Access to library resources remains one of the most significant challenges to the independent scholar. Access to most paid library resources, such as databases and paywalled journals, far exceeds the resources of many smaller institutions, including RIIS 2.0.</span></p>

<p class="c29 c44"><span class="c9 c7">RIIS 2.0 charges membership dues for Fellows to ensure organizational sustainability and member accountability, while preserving the nonprofit’s mission of supporting independent scholarship. This rationale is grounded in both practical needs and governance principles, as reflected in RIIS 2.0’s bylaws and policies. Maintaining RIIS 2.0 costs money, including:</span></p>
<ul class="c11 lst-kix_n8tqulgamqo3-0 start">
<li class="c32 c29 li-bullet-0"><span class="c9 c7">Website hosting and digital platforms (e.g., Zoom, domain name, email, file storage)</span></li>
<li class="c32 c29 li-bullet-0"><span class="c9 c7">State and federal incorporation and annual compliance fees</span></li>
<li class="c32 c29 li-bullet-0"><span class="c9 c7">Insurance</span></li>
<li class="c29 c32 li-bullet-0"><span class="c9 c7">Legal services</span></li>
<li class="c32 c29 li-bullet-0"><span class="c9 c7">Accounting services</span></li>
</ul>
<p class="c44 c29"><span class="c10 c7">In alignment with our Belonging Policy and our commitment to equitable access to scholarship, we plan to soon have ways that affiliates (</span><span class="c10 c7">especially those from </span><span class="c7 c29">World Bank-defined Low &amp; Middle Income countries)</span><span class="c10 c7"> can join at a discounted or subsidized rate. In </span><span class="c10 c7">the previous NJ-based Ronin Institute, some of these costs (such as digital platforms) were paid directly by members of that Board, and thus, affiliates were heavily subsidised. </span></p>
</details><details style="color: inherit; background: transparent; border: none; margin: 0; padding: 0;"><summary class="c29 c31" id="h.28kia5bvtzof" style="color: inherit; background: transparent; cursor: pointer;"><span class="c1">What benefits will I gain as a member? </span></summary>
<p class="c15"><span class="c10 c7">Most importantly, you will have voting rights as a Fellow and a say in the type of institute that RIIS 2.0 becomes, having an impact on the future of independent scholarship and its role in greater society. You will be able to use “Ronin Institute for Independent Scholarship 2.0 (RIIS 2.0)” as an affiliation on any of your academic work, including papers, proposals, presentations, signatures, etc., </span><span class="c10 c7 c22 c23">but </span><span class="c9 c7">RIIS 2.0 does not endorse individual work; responsibility for content rests with the author. You will also be connected with other RIIS 2.0. research scholars to be part of a community where we can exchange and share knowledge, through our new RIIS 2.0 Discord workspace and community events (mostly online). </span></p>
<p class="c15"><span class="c9 c7">We hope to be able to offer forwarding email addresses to Fellows fairly soon, which would allow inbound mail to your personal email. As we are still a very new institute, we will be relying on our inaugural members to create the other benefits we hope to offer. Please join us as an Affiliate to help us build RIIS 2.0 and figure out what these will be!</span></p>

<p class="c12"><span class="c10 c7">No. When you join RIIS 2.0 as a dues-paying member, you are designated a </span><span class="c10 c7 c22">Fellow</span><span class="c10 c7"> with full membership voting and participation rights. </span><span class="c10 c7">Non-dues-paying </span><span class="c10 c7 c22">Associates</span><span class="c10 c7"> may attend community events and working groups, but are non-voting and do not vote in Council or Fellowship decisions.

<p class="c54 c29 c45"><span class="c10 c7">Yes, in some cases they do. Research Scholars can hold dual (or multiple) affiliations with traditional academic/research institutions, or with other research organizations (like </span><span class="c6"><a class="c21" href="https://igdore.org/">IGDORE</a></span><span class="c9 c7">). Holding multiple affiliations is consistent with our mission: facilitating scholarship in whatever mode works best for each individual Research Scholar. In many cases, holding a traditional academic or other research institute appointment alongside their Research Scholar position may be the best way for a scholar to support their research.</span></p>
</details><details style="color: inherit; background: transparent; border: none; margin: 0; padding: 0;"><summary class="c31 c29" id="h.gdedqfssex79" style="color: inherit; background: transparent; cursor: pointer;"><span class="c1">How do I use this affiliation, for example, in a publication?</span></summary>
<p class="c2"><span class="c10 c7">We recommend using the full legal name as your affiliation, e.g.<br /><br />        </span><span class="c10 c7 c22 c37">Your Name, Ronin Institute for Independent Scholarship 2.0</span></p>
<p class="c2"><span class="c10 c7">If  this is too long, or if an abbreviation is permitted, the following are acceptable alternatives:<br /><br />        </span><span class="c10 c7 c22">Ronin Institute (RIIS 2.0)<br /></span><span class="c10 c7">        </span><span class="c37 c10 c7 c22">RIIS 2.0 </span></p>
<p class="c2"><span class="c10 c7">We </span><span class="c10 c7 c48">strongly advise against</span><span class="c9 c7"> using “Ronin Institute" without qualification, to avoid confusion with the former NJ-based organization. If an affiliation requires a physical address, please use the city, state, and zip code form (do not use the street, most journals no longer require street information):</span></p>

<p class="c2"><span class="c10 c7">RIIS 2.0 does not possess physical lab space. Some Research Scholars whose work involves laboratory-based experiments also have an affiliation with a university or research institution with those facilities. Others work with collaborators who have access to lab space. In certain metropolitan areas, there are now also facilities where you can rent access to lab equipment on a short-term basis (e.g., bio-hacker spaces).</span></p>

<span class="c7">Ronin Institute for Independent Scholarship 2.0 (RIIS 2.0) is a California Nonprofit Public Benefit Corporation, recognized as tax-exempt under Section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code. It was incorporated on </span><span class="c7 c22">2025/04/23</span><span class="c7"> under EIN </span><span class="c7 c22">33-4776448</span><span class="c3">.</span>
</li>
<li class="c4 li-bullet-0">
<span class="c7">The </span><span class="c7 c22">original Ronin Institute</span><span class="c7"> was a New Jersey-based 501(c)(3) nonprofit incorporated in 2012 that is now </span><span class="c7 c22">defunct</span><span class="c3">, having ceased operations and legally dissolved itself in September 2024 and relinquished or shut down key infrastructure (e.g., Slack, email, and website hosting) and finances.</span>
</li>
<li class="c4 li-bullet-0">
<span class="c7">There is </span><span class="c7 c22">no legal continuity</span><span class="c7"> between the two entities. RIIS 2.0 has its </span><span class="c7 c22">own Articles of Incorporation, bylaws, EIN, and a governing Council</span><span class="c7">.

<p class="c54 c29 c45"><span class="c7">Research Scholars of the </span><span class="c7">former Ronin Institute do not automatically become Fellows of RIIS 2.0, as there is no legal continuity between the organizations (see previous question), and all new Fellows need to agree to new policies and pay dues.

<li class="c4 li-bullet-0">
<span class="c7 c22">Bylaws group:</span><span class="c7"> A group of Research Scholars, who were n</span><span class="c7">ot </span><span class="c7">connected</span><span class="c7"> to the Board of Directors of the now-dissolved NJ-based Ronin Institute, formed a bylaws group to explore creating a new set of bylaws that could be the basis of either a continuation of the old Ronin Institute or a new organization for Research Scholars. The group was open to any former member. </span><span class="c7">Meetings were open to all former members of the</span><span class="c7"> </span><span class="c7">now-dissolved NJ-based Ronin Institute and colleagues</span><span class="c7">, and all discussions were reported in the </span><span class="c6"><a class="c21" href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/11ObGQkSDG3-72sgqlqa3rQ5GUvorB1PaU5J5LwQHvAc/edit?tab=t.0#heading=h.7u61mvlsqhuj">bylaws group meeting notes</a></span><span class="c7 c22">.</span><span class="c14 c7"> </span>
</li>
<li class="c4 li-bullet-0">
<span class="c7 c22">Survey conducted</span><span class="c7">: The by-laws group also developed a survey that was sent out to previous Ronin Scholars in early</span><span class="c7"> November 2024. The</span><span class="c6"><a class="c21" href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1buactBjr1674RRAKgG-Q7-PusYWqayijXv3s65exKsI/edit?slide=id.p#slide=id.p"> summary of the results of the survey </a></span><span class="c7">was</span><span class="c3"> released as part of a presentation by Ruth Duerr in January 2025 (Due to GDPR privacy rules, we can not share the raw results of the survey since it captured personally identifiable information.) In late 2024, the NJ-based organization legally dissolved itself, leaving the creation of a new organization as the only path forward. </span>
</li>
<li class="c4 li-bullet-0">
<span class="c7 c22">By-laws drafting</span><span class="c7">: After a lengthy drafting period between November 2024 and March 2025, where any volunteer was welcome to comment on the evolving documents, and after a review of the documents by pro-bono lawyers, the by-laws were deemed to be ready. </span><span class="c7">The bylaws were drafted by a working group of volunteers, with </span><span class="c7">contributions</span><span class="c3"> from the current Interim Council, including Ruth Duerr, Rami Saydjari, J De Loatch, Carolyn Sealfon, Alex Lancaster, Elena Fujiwara, and many former Ronin Institute Research Scholars, including Herbert J Bernstein, Arika Virapongse, Daniel Mietchen, Allan Tameshtit, Nick Jackson, Keith Tse, John Larocco, Jorrit Poelen, Tom Buckholtz, Anne Thessen, Rebecca Koskela, and Laure Haak, to whom we owe many thanks.</span>
</li>
<li class="c4 li-bullet-0">
<span class="c7">Only those who directly participated in drafting the final version are formally listed, but all feedback was considered.</span><span class="c7"> </span><span class="c7">The drafts of the bylaws are available </span><span class="c6"><a class="c21" href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1KY8E_xia5vTVfBBLVGmcUW2ncPZi0btc8YHty0Pm8E4/edit?usp=drive_link">online</a></span><span class="c7">, and the approved are available in the </span><span class="c6"><a class="c21" href="https://records.ronininstitute.org/bylaws.pdf">Records site</a></span><span class="c7">.</span>
</li>
<li class="c4 li-bullet-0">
<span class="c7 c22">Incorporation</span><span class="c3">: In late March of 2025, the by-laws group moved forward with creating a new legal entity with an Interim Council consisting of six volunteers who were regular contributors to the by-laws group. On 22 April 2025, RIIS 2.0 came into existence by filing for incorporation with the State of California, and the bylaws group was dissolved. A new document repository was established for RIIS 2.0, and the work of the bylaws group was archived.</span>
</li>
<li class="c4 li-bullet-0">
<span class="c7 c22">After Incorporation:</span><span class="c3"> a set of onboarding policies, Belonging, Code of Conduct, Terms of Service, and Privacy were developed so that Fellows could be onboarded with legal protections for the Fellows and the organization.</span>
</li>
<li class="c4 li-bullet-0">
<span class="c7 c22">Community input</span><span class="c7">: Throughout the process of the development of RIIS 2.0, prospective members (many from the now-dissolved </span><span class="c7">NJ-based Ronin Institute) were invited to participate in discussions, such as through recurring meetings, notices, and updates posted on a Discord channel and a Google Group account that were set up by and open to joining from former Research Scholars. Those who participated in working groups and meetings contributed directly to the decision-making process.</span>

<p class="c28 c29"><span class="c3">Since we had no external funding, everyone who volunteered to be involved pulled together their existing resources. For example, one interim council member had a free Zoom account from her previous role at the University of Colorado in Boulder (CU Boulder) that she could use to host meetings until such time as we had a separate Zoom account for the organization. Other participants made interest-free loans to RIIS 2.0 by paying for state filing fees, Board insurance, and domain name registration.</span></p>

<p class="c12"><span class="c3">In one of the early surveys, potential members were polled for the location of incorporation. This poll did not include all 50 states, but only a few that made sense to the bylaws team.</span></p>
<p class="c12"><span class="c3">Colorado was included on the survey because:</span></p>
<ul class="c11 lst-kix_eipz3wld1zd1-0 start">
<li class="c13 c33 c40 li-bullet-0"><span class="c3">The original Ronin Institute was already in the State of Colorado business database</span></li>
<li class="c13 c33 c40 li-bullet-0"><span class="c3">There were many original Ronin Institute Research Scholars in the state</span></li>
</ul>
<p class="c13 c55"><span class="c3">California was included on the survey because:</span></p>
<ul class="c11 lst-kix_itidrdxfj3q7-0 start">
<li class="c13 c33 c40 li-bullet-0"><span class="c3">California has remained the 5th largest economy in the world since 2017</span></li>
<li class="c13 c33 c40 li-bullet-0"><span class="c3">There were many former Ronin Institute Research Scholars in the state</span></li>
</ul>
<p class="c12"><span class="c3">While this  survey showed a slight preference for Colorado, the by-laws group chose  California because:</span></p>
<ul class="c11 lst-kix_duffcykg6q7g-0 start">
<li class="c13 c33 c40 li-bullet-0"><span class="c3">The dissolution of the original Ronin Institute negated the utility of entry in the State of Colorado business database since a new corporation was required. Incorporation in Colorado requires a physical address, but incorporation in California does not, and the new corporation is completely virtual. </span></li>
<li class="c13 c33 c40 li-bullet-0">
<span class="c7">California has one of the largest nonprofit sectors in the U.S and </span><span class="c7">is</span><span class="c7 c8"> </span><span class="c3">quite friendly towards nonprofits. </span>
</li>
<li class="c4 li-bullet-0"><span class="c3">The bylaws team had also benefited from strong legal connections in California (an Interim Council member), but not in Colorado. </span></li>

<p class="c12"><span class="c10 c7">The people on the Interim Council are those who initially volunteered to do the hard work of getting the institute incorporated and legally/financially solvent enough to accept members. This is in keeping with the former NJ-based Ronin </span><span class="c10 c7">Institute's</span><span class="c10 c7"> policy of </span><span class="c6"><a class="c21" href="https://medlabboulder.gitlab.io/democraticmediums/mediums/do-ocracy/">Do-ocracy</a></span><span class="c10 c7">.  Since they are “interim,” however, once there are enough members or after an agreed-upon time for new members to join, then we will hold elections to elect a new Council (please refer to the Bylaws for how this works). </span></p>
